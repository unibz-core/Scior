    rdfs:comment                  """The objective of gUFO is to provide a lightweight implementation of the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) [1-5] suitable for Semantic Web OWL 2 DL applications.

Intended users are those implementing UFO-based lightweight ontologies that reuse gUFO by specializing and instantiating its elements.

There are three implications of the use of the term lightweight. First of all, we have employed little expressive means in an effort to retain computational properties for the resulting OWL ontology. Second, we have selected a subset of UFO-A [1, 2] and UFO-B [3] to include here. In particular, there is minimalistic support for UFO-B (only that which is necessary to establish the participation of objects in events and to capture historical dependence between events). Third, a lightweight ontology, differently from a reference ontology, is designed with the purpose of providing an implementation artifact to structure a knowledge base (or knowledge graph). This has driven a number of pragmatic implementation choices which are discussed in comments annotated to the various elements of this implementation. 

The 'g' in gUFO stands for gentle. At the same time, \"gufo\" is the Italian word for \"owl\".

For background information on the reference ontology on which this implementation is based, see:

    rdfs:comment    """A gufo:Collection for which change in membership is possible.

Such a collection obeys an intensional principle of identity, i.e., change in membership does not necessarily create a different collection.

For example, KLM's fleet of airplanes could be understood as a gufo:VariableCollection. In this case, when the company acquires (or retires) an airplane, the fleet changes. Note that, in this case, the airplanes are conceptualized as playing the role of \"member of a fleet\". If various roles for the parts of a fleet were envisioned (such as \"cargo airplane\", \"passenger airplane\"), then a fleet would be best understood as a gufo:FunctionalComplex.

See gufo:TemporaryParthoodSituation for the pattern to represent the relation of a variable collection to its temporary parts."""@en ;
